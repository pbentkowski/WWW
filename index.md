## Welcome!

&nbsp;

I am a researcher with over a decade of experience in [computational biology](http://www.cbd.cmu.edu/about-us/what-is-computational-biology/). I&nbsp;specialise in understanding biological processes by employing computer simulations and analysis of large volumes of data. During my university days I studied ecology and computational methods of physics. My experience covers also handling of large datasets of biological information (RNA / DNA sequences, annotated genes, epidemiological surveillance information) and statistical analysis of data. I also co-developped a model the [spread of influenza in France](https://chiara-poletto.github.io/research.html) during seasonal epidemics. I code in Python and C++.

Currently, I work in data science in IT industry.

For many years I have been volunteering for non-government organisations. At the moment, I'm involved in a science advocacy group ["Nauka dla Przyrody"](https://naukadlaprzyrody.pl/) ("Science for Nature") consisting of Polish environmental researchers. NdP is calling for science-driven nature conservation efforts.

If you want to contact me, go and [**FIND_ME**](/7_CONTACT). This web page is a bit of a lavish résumé.
