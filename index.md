## Welcome!

I am a theoretical biologist with over a decade of experience in academic research. My work focuses on deciphering complex biological processes using computational simulations and analyzing large-scale datasets. In recent years, my research has primarily centered on epidemiology and investigating the behavioral impact of pharmaceutical pollutants on animals.

My academic background is rooted in ecology and computational physics, which has provided me with a solid foundation in data-driven biological research. I have extensive experience handling large biological datasets, including RNA/DNA sequences, annotated genomes, and epidemiological surveillance data, alongside conducting rigorous statistical analyses. Notably, I co-developed a model for simulating the spread of seasonal influenza in France.

Currently, I work on data-driven epidemiological models at the University of Warsaw at the [Centre for Systemic Risk Analysis](https://cbrs.uw.edu.pl/en/about-the-centre/).
