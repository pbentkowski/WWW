## Welcome!

&nbsp;

I am a computational biologist with over a decade of research experience. My work focuses on unravelling complex biological processes through computational simulations and analysing large-scale data sets. Recently, my research has been centred on epidemiology and exploring how pharmaceutical pollutants affect animal behaviour.

My academic foundation combines evolutionary ecology and computational physics. I have significant experience working with large biological data sets, including RNA/DNA sequences, annotated genomes, and epidemiological surveillance data, as well as performing in-depth statistical analyses. Until recently, I was involved in developing data-driven epidemiological models at the University of Warsawâ€™s [Centre for Systemic Risk Analysis](https://cbrs.uw.edu.pl/en/about-the-centre/) and recently have moved to [Military Institute of Medicine - National Research Institute](https://wim.mil.pl/).
