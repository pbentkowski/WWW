I am a researcher with over a decade of experience woking as a theoretical biologist.. I&nbsp;specialise in understanding biological processes by employing computer simulations and analysis of large volumes of data. During my university days I studied ecology and computational methods of physics. My experience covers also handling of large data sets of biological information (RNA / DNA sequences, annotated genes, epidemiological surveillance information) and statistical analysis of data. I also co-developed a model the spread of influenza in France during seasonal epidemics. I code in Python and C++.

After a brief brush with IT industry, I work on data-driven epidemiological models at the University of Warsaw.
