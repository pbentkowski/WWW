## Welcome!

I am a computational biologist with over a decade of research experience. My work focuses on unraveling complex biological processes through computational simulations and analyzing large-scale datasets. Recently, my research has been centered on epidemiology and exploring how pharmaceutical pollutants affect animal behavior.

My academic foundation combines evolutionary ecology and computational physics. I have significant experience working with large biological datasets, including RNA/DNA sequences, annotated genomes, and epidemiological surveillance data, as well as performing in-depth statistical analyses. Until recently, I was involved in developing data-driven epidemiological models at the University of Warsaw’s [Centre for Systemic Risk Analysis](https://cbrs.uw.edu.pl/en/about-the-centre/).

Feel free to [**contact me**]() if you'd like to connect. **I’m currently open to new job opportunities!**
