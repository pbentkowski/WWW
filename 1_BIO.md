I grew up in [Warsaw](https://warsawtour.pl/en/sightseeing-routes/), Poland's capital city, and I am 'the 90's kid'. I graduated in Environmental Biology from the University of Warsaw. I also studied Computational Methods of Physics at the same university. I defended my Ph.D. at the School of Environmental Sciences, University of East Anglia in Norwich, UK.

Since then, I have worked as a bio-modeller and a bioinformatician in research institutes in Warsaw, Poznań and now in Paris.

For more detailed info on projects I did, see the tab [**RESEARCH**](/3_RESEARCH).
