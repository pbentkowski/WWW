I"ã<p>MHC genes, which code for proteins responsible for presenting pathogen-derived antigens to the host immune system, show huge copy-number variation both between and within species. However, the evolutionary forces driving this variation are not understood very well. We used computer simulations to investigate whether the evolution of the number of MHC variants in the genome can be shaped by the number of pathogen species the host population encounters (pathogen richness).</p>
