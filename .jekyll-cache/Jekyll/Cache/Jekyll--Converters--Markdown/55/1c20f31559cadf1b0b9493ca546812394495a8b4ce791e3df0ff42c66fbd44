    Few words about the most important aspect of the modern scientific folklore - Citing. And how it is done. Not too serious.

    We have gotten published! Jacek Radwan and I published a paper titled "Mating preferences can drive expansion or contraction of major histocompatibility complex gene family" for which I created agent-based model simulations.

    We have gotten published! Jacek Radwan and I published a paper titled "Evolution of major histocompatibility complex gene copy number". It's a theoretical study using agent-based simulation I'd coded addressing the question how parasite diversity, their speed of evolution and costs of expressing MHC proteins shape the MHC genes' individual copy number variation in hosts.
