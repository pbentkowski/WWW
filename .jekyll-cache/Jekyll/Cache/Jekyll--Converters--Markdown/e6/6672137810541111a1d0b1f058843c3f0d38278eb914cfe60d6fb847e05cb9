<p>I am a researcher with over a decade of experience in <a href="http://www.cbd.cmu.edu/about-us/what-is-computational-biology/">computational biology</a>. I specialise in understanding biological processes by employing computer simulations and analysis of large volumes of data. During my university days I studied ecology and computational methods of physics. My experience covers also handling of large datasets of biological information (RNA / DNA sequences, annotated genes, epidemiological surveillance information) and statistical analysis of data. I code in Python and C++.</p>

<p>Currently, I model the <a href="https://chiara-poletto.github.io/research.html">spread of influenza in France</a> during seasonal epidemics.</p>

<p>For many years I have been volunteering for non-government organisations. At the moment, I’m involved in a science advocacy group <a href="https://naukadlaprzyrody.pl/">“Nauka dla Przyrody”</a> (“Science for Nature”) consisting of Polish environmental researchers. NdP is calling for science-driven nature conservation efforts.</p>
