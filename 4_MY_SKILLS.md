title: MY_SKILLS
---

I studied Environmental Biology (specialising in aquatic ecology) and Computational Methods of Physics (learning how to model physical processes using computers). Since then I have worked in scientific research improving my skills with each project.

For more detailed info on projects I did, see the tab [**RESEARCH**](/3_RESEARCH). To learn where I gained these skills, see the tab [**BIO**](/1_BIO).

### CODING & COMPUTER

|--|--
|**Python**|Coding for data analysis and data visualization: Numpy, Pandas, Scipy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, a bit of [Peewee](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/), analysis of voluminous data (that cannot fit in RAM in one chunk)
|**C++**|Intermediate coder using C++ for building custom (and resonantly fast) [simulation](https://github.com/pbentkowski/MHC_Evolution) of complicated biological processes, big fan of the Standard Template Library and [Open MP](https://github.com/pbentkowski/Random-Numbers-and-Multithreading-in-C-11)
|**Linux**|Power user: scripting in Bash and a bit in AWK, good understanding of the system's backbone, no GUI required, using Linux since 2004
|**Version control**|Using [git](https://bentkowski.net/repos.html) for version tracking and code sharing
|**HPC**|Running computations on remote high power cluster computers, automation of large volumes of computations that can run for days without supervision
|**MATLAB**|Some experience in the past, later switched to Python (Matlab's license is a bit pricey)

&nbsp;

### MATHS & STATS

|--|--
|**Basic&nbsp;math**|Three years of undergrad studies at a physics faculty: formal logic, calculus, probability theory, fuzzy set theory and things like that
|**Optimization**|Fitting models, selecting parameters
|**Stats**|ANOVA and linear models, bootstrapping, solid foundation in understanding mathematics behind statistics
|**ML&nbsp;/&nbsp;AI**|Soon... [learning it](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/python-machine-learning-second-edition)

&nbsp;

### SCIENCE & RESEARCH

|--|--
|**Ecology**|Graduated in Environmental Biology doing experimental aquatic ecology at the [Department of Hydrobiology](http://www.hydro.biol.uw.edu.pl/en), University of Warsaw, I worked on the [ecophysiology of plankton](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226083801_Role_of_melatonin_in_the_control_of_depth_distribution_of_Daphnia_magna) and fish
|**Evolution**|I studied evolution of bacterial genomes, later non-coding RNA and later major histocompatibility coplex (MHC) genes
|**Modelling biology**|Agent-based modelling is my research specialty since few years, I do custom simulations of problems too complex to use more traditional mathematics
|**Scientific writing**|Published author of research articles in English and Polish, completed number of courses dedicated to scientific writing, author of pop-science pieces in Polish

&nbsp;

### SOFT SKILLS

|--|--
|**Languages**|English (very good), Polish (native), Russian (communicative), German (basic)
|**Teamwork**|Contributing member of a team up to 30 members • leading a small team up to 6 members • working in a multinational environment • working in groups scattered across institutions, towns and countries • using networking and data sharing software such as Slack, GitHub, BitBucket
|**Social&nbsp;media**|Responsible for social media presence of grassroots academic organizations Obywatele Nauki (2012-2018, [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/obywatelenauki/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/obywatelenauki)) and Nauka dla Przyrody (2017-present, [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wierzewbialowieze/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/naukaprzyrody)). I learned to write short notes containing condensed information
