My code can be found in two, mostly identical, repositories. Bitbucket provides (or at least used to) private repositories for scientists with university affiliation, what is convenient for ongoing projects. But everyone is on GitHub these days! And this is the place where are my published projects.

Unfortunately, some of my employment contracts did not allow me to make the projects' code public.


I'm also on ResearchGate where you can see my scientific papers.
